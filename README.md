# Phoenix Web Development
This is the code repository for [Phoenix Web Development](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/phoenix-web-development?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787284197), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
With Elixir and Phoenix, you build your application the right way the first way: ready to scale and ready for the increasing demands of real-time web applications.

This book will cover the bare basics of the Phoenix web framework through building a community voting application and, in the course, discuss the new structure changes introduced in Phoenix v1.3. We'll cover the initial challenges of getting started with our app, working with the generators to learn more about the structure of a standard Phoenix app. From there, we'll build our application and work with Channels, Schemas, Contexts, and even dive into more advanced topics such as working with Tasks/Async and GenServers. By the end of this book, we'll have a strong grasp of all the core fundamentals of the Phoenix framework, and we'll have built a full production-ready web application from nothing!
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
person = %{ name: "Brandon" }
person = %{ name: "Richey" }
```

Readers should already have at least a basic understanding of the Elixir programming language and some beginner-level knowledge of common web development terms and techniques. You will also need an internet-capable programming environment where you can install required software such as Elixir, Phoenix, Node.js, and Postgres
